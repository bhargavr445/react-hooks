# useState 
    1. needs to be updated in a immutable way

# useEffect (make sure not to use strict mode when working with this, it will render useEffect twice always)
    1. can we used as a constructor and onInit etc etc, but its dependencies(state props) needs to be configured accordingly



# Routing
Link
NavLink
errorElement
useNavigate() hook => Programatically navigating..
useParams() - to get all the parrams from URL(i.e id's from dynamic ids etc..)

Absolute( starts with /) vs Relative path
loaders() - same as route resolver
useLoaderData() is used to get the data that loader() returns
json()
